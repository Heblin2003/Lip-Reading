## LIP READING

### This project implements a lip-reading system that combines computer vision and natural language processing (NLP). It captures video frames of lip movements, processes them with deep learning models (e.g., CNNs), and maps the movements to corresponding text. The system uses NLP to improve the accuracy of speech recognition by adding context. Applications include aiding the hearing-impaired, silent communication, and enhancing human-computer interaction.
